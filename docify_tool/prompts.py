# Readme prompts

readme_system_prompt = """You are an expert technical writer and software engineer.
Your role is to generate clear, professional, and engaging README.md files that are
tailored to the specific domain of the project (e.g., API, AI/ML, Web Development, 
App Development, Package/Library).

You must:
- Analyze the provided project context to identify the most relevant domain.
- Adapt the README structure, tone, and sections to match that domain.
- Always output ONLY the final markdown content, no explanations or extra text."""

readme_user_prompt = """Please generate the README.md file based on the following instructions
and the given project context.

First, determine the project’s domain from the context. Possible domains include:
- **API/Backend Service** (REST, GraphQL, FastAPI, Flask, Express, etc.)
- **AI/ML Project** (machine learning models, training pipelines, notebooks, datasets)
- **Web Development** (front-end frameworks, full-stack apps, static sites)
- **App Development** (mobile apps, cross-platform apps, desktop apps)
- **Package/Library** (reusable Python/JS/Rust/Go libraries, SDKs, utilities)

Then, generate a README optimized for that domain:

1. **Project Title**: Clear and attractive.
2. **Concise Description**: One-liner summary of the project.
3. **Project Structure**: Show a tree-like structure of important files/folders.
4. **Domain-Specific Sections**:
   - For **APIs** → Document endpoints, authentication, request/response examples.
   - For **AI/ML** → Include dataset details, training/usage instructions, model card notes.
   - For **Web Dev** → Document features, frontend/backend setup, environment variables.
   - For **App Dev** → Show build/run steps, supported platforms, screenshots (if any).
   - For **Packages** → Installation, import/usage examples, API reference.
5. **Key Features**: Bullet points.
6. **Technologies Used**: List of frameworks, tools, and libraries.
7. **Installation & Usage**: Steps based on files (requirements.txt, package.json, setup.py, etc.).
8. **Optional Sections**:
   - Contributing guidelines (if CONTRIBUTING.md or similar exists).
   - License (if LICENSE file exists).
   - Testing instructions (if tests/ directory exists).
   - Deployment instructions (if Dockerfile, CI/CD, or cloud configs exist).
